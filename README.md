These are my set of completed programs to the problems from https://data-representation.github.io/problems/go-fundamentals.html
## How to Run The Programs

*Assumes that Git and Go are installed along with the prerequisites.*
**If not, they can be found from https://golang.org/dl/ and https://git-scm.com/downloads 

**1. Clone the Repository**
```bash
> git clone https://github.com/mattshiel/go-problem-sheet-group-c.git
```
**2. Change Directory to the Folder**

```bash
Open the terminal/command line and navigate into the folder 
eg. > cd go-problem-sheet-group-c
```

**2. Compile the Program**

```bash
Before you run the program you must compile it using go build 
eg. > go build 02time.go
```

**3. Run the Program**

```bash
To run the program enter './' followed by the executable produced
For Mac:
> ./01_konnichiwa
For Windows:
> ./01_konnichiwa.go.exe
```

*Repeat steps 2 and 3 as necessary for each program, replacing the program name with the one you want to compile and run in either instance*
